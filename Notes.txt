===> What is cloud computing?
- Dedicated server
    - One physical machine Dedicated to a single business. 
    - Runs a single we-app/ site.

- Virtual private server
    - One physical machine Dedicated to a single business. 
    - The physical machine is Virtualized into sub-machines.
    - Runs multiple web apps

- Shared hosting 
    - One physical machine shard by multiple business.     
    - Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.

- cloud hosting
    - Multiple physical machines that act as one system.
    - The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services


===> Common cloud services
- Compute : Imagine having a virtual computer that can run application, programs and code.
- Storage : Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
- Networking : Imagine having the virtual network being able to define internet connections or network isolations.
- Databases : Imagine a virtual Database or storing reporting data or a Database for general purpose web- application.


===> Benifits of cloud computing
- Cost effective
- Global
- Secure
- Reliable
- Scalable
- Elastic
- Current


===> Types of cloud computing

- SaaS : software as a services
    - A product that is run and managed by the service provider.

- PaaS : Platform as a service
    - Focus on the deployement and management of your apps.

- IaaS : Infrastructure as a service
    - The basic building blocks of cloudIT.    


===> Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
    - Spending money upfront on physical Infrastructure.
    - Server Cost
    - Storage Cost
    - network Cost
    - Backup and archieve Cost
    - Disaster Recovery Cost
    - Datacenter Cost


===> Operational expenditure (OPEX)
    - The costs associated with an on- premises datacenter that has shifted the cost to the service provider.
      The customer only has to be concerned with non- physical costs.
    - Leasing software and customizing features
    - Training employees in cloud services
    - Paying for cloud support
    - Billing based on cloud metrics
        - Compute usage 
        - Storage usage


===> cloud architecture terminologies
    - Availability: Your ability to ensure a service remains available
    - Scalability : Your ability to grow rapidly or unimpeded
    - Elasticity : Your ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand
    - Fault tolerance : Your ability to recover from a failure.
    - Disaster Recovery : Your ability to recover from a failure            


===> Computing services 
    - Azure virtual machines: Windows or linux virtual machines. The most common type of compute.
      you can choose your OS, Memory, CPU , Storage

    - Azure container instances: Docker as a service. Run containerized apps on Azure without procisioning servers or VMs.

    - Azure Kubernetes : Kubernetes as a service. Easy to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications.

    - Azure Service Fabric: Tier 1 Enterprise containers as a service
      Distributed systems platform. Runs in Azure or on- premises.
      Easy to package, deploy and manage scalable and Reliable microservices

    - Azure functions: Event driven, serverless compute(functions) run code without provisioning or managing servers.

    - Azure batch: Plans, schedules and executes your batch computer workloads across running 100+ jobs in parallel.


===> Storage services: 
    - Azure blob storage: 
        Object serverless storage: Store very large files and large amounts of unstructured files.
    
    - Azure disk storage: A virtual volume. Choose SSD or HDD, encryption by default.

    - Azure file storage: A shared volumes that you can access and manage like file server.

    - Azure queue storage : 
        Message queues: A data store for queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications.

    - Azure table storage: 
        Wide column NoSQL Database : A NoSQL store that hosts unstructured data independently of any schema.

    - Azure data box: A rugged briefcase computer and storage designed to move terabytes or petabytes of data.

    - Azure archieve storage: Long term storage for when you need to hold onto files for years on the cheapest storage options.

    - Azure data lake storage : A centralized repository that allos you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale.


===> Cloud native networking services 
    -Azure DNS: provide ultra- fast DNS responsess and ultra high domain Availability.

    - Azure Virtual Network (vNET) : a logical isolated section of the azure network for customers to launch azure resources within.

    - Azure load balancer: OSI level 4 (Transport) Load balancer

    - Azure application gateway: OSI level 7 (HTTP) load balancer, can apply a web application firewall

    - Network security groups : A virtual firewall at the subnet level


===>  Big Data and analytics serives 
    - A term used to describe massive volumes of structured/ unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to move and process using traditional database and software techniques.

    - Azure Synapse Analytics : Enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics.

    - HDInsight: Run open source analytics software such as Hadoop, Kafka and Spark.

    - Azure Databrics : An apache Spark- based analytics platform optimized for the microsoft azure cloud services platform.
      Third party databricks cloud services supported withing azure 

    - Data lake analytics: An on demand analytics job service that simplifies big data.


===> Serverless service
    - When the underlying server, Infrastructure and OS is taken care of by the cloud service provider (CSP) It will generally be highly available, scalable and cost effective.

    - Event driven scale: A serverless function can be triggered or trigger other events allowing you to compose complex applications and its just scales.

    - Abstraction of servers: Servers are abstracted away. your code is described as functions. These functions can be running on different compute instances.

    - Micro- billing : Serverless compute could run for a fraction of a second. Billing into micro- seconds will save you money.


===> Azure security - complaince programs
    - National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework(CSF)
        - Voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity.

    - UK GOvernment G-Cloud: Cloud computing certification for services used by the GOvernment entities in the UK.

    - Federal INformation Processing Standard (FIPS)- 140-2
        - US and canadian GOvernment standard that specifies the security requirements for the cryptographic modules that modules that protect sensitive INformation.
